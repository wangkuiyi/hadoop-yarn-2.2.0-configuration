I succesfully configured a Hadoop YARN 2.2.0 cluster on three VirtualBox virtual machines running Ubuntu.

The configuraiton generally comes from this tech blog [post](http://milinda.pathirage.org/hadoop/yarn/2013/09/29/how-to-setup-multi-node-hadoop-20xyarn-cluster.html).  However, I also corrected a few mistakes.

Also, an option is added to support WebHDFS access.
